# hello-world
My first repository of many

My name is Rafael and I'm in a computer science master's program at UNIFEI. My interest areas are robotics and artificial intelligence. Here in my GitHub page I plan on hosting most of my school projects, personal projects, the exercises I do while I study different subjects and probably more.

I'm creating this hello-world repository as I follow a simple GitHub tutorial, aiming to get started to use GitHub.

So let's go!
